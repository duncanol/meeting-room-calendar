  <h1>Meeting Room bookings</h1>
  
  <p>
    The idea of this little application will be to allow an administrator to
    administer a list of Meeting Rooms and for normal users to be able to
    book those meeting rooms for slots of time. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Functionality will be tackled in the below order:
    <ol>
      <li>Add new Meeting Room</li>
      <li>Edit Meeting Room</li>
      <li>Remove Meeting Room</li>
      <li>Make it look nice so far - introduce Bootstrap</li>
      <li>Reorder files and folders to make development nicer</li>
      <li>Book a slot for a Meeting Room</li>
      <li>Cancel a booking</li>
      <li>Try to make it look nice again!</li>
      <li>Adding User accounts and permissions</li>
      <li>Security - removing rapid prototyping features</li>
      <li>Deploying to node.js server</li>
      <li>Deploying to Meteor infrastructure</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  
  <h2>Current state of our application</h2>
  <p>
    So far all we have is:
    <ul>
      <li>this static piece of HTML being served by Meteor</li>
      <li>a barebones javascript file with logging on both the client- and server-side</li>
      <li>a default folder structure with room for improvement</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h3>Things to talk about</h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is Meteor?</li>
      <li>Current state</li>
      <li>What is Node.js?</li>
      <li>Starting a project</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h3>Things to experiment with</h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Try some live HTML and javascript changes with various clients!</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
