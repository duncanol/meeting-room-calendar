      The idea of this little application will be to allow an administrator to
      administer a list of Meeting Rooms and for normal users to be able to
      book those meeting rooms for slots of time.

        Functionality will be tackled in the below order:
        <ol>
          <li class="task-complete">Add new Meeting Room</li>
          <li class="task-complete">Edit Meeting Room</li>
          <li class="task-complete">Remove Meeting Room</li>
          <li class="task-complete">Make it look nice so far - introduce Bootstrap</li>
          <li class="task-complete">Reorder files and folders to make development nicer</li>
          <li>Book a slot for a Meeting Room</li>
          <li>Cancel a booking</li>
          <li>Try to make it look nice again!</li>
          <li>Adding User accounts and permissions</li>
          <li>Security - removing rapid prototyping features</li>
          <li>Deploying to node.js server</li>
          <li>Deploying to Meteor infrastructure</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A booking mechanism but no way yet of viewing them from the UI.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Semi-relational linking between Asset records and booking records.  More support for constraints in Mongo?</li>
          <li>Could have bookings as a list field within each Asset record instead of having its own Collection.  Queries?</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="well">
      <h3>Things to experiment with</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Different constraints in Mongo</li>
          <li>Advanced Mongo queries</li>

        jQuery has now been installed as a package and booking functionality added as a simple 
        Bootstrap modal with input fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bookings are being persisted in the database but not yet viewable from the UI.  They 
        can be checked out manually though in the mongo CLI or via the console.
