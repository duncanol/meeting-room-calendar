      The idea of this little application will be to allow an administrator to
      administer a list of Meeting Rooms and for normal users to be able to
      book those meeting rooms for slots of time.

        Functionality will be tackled in the below order:
        <ol>
          <li class="task-complete">Add new Meeting Room</li>
          <li class="task-complete">Edit Meeting Room</li>
          <li class="task-complete">Remove Meeting Room</li>
          <li class="task-complete">Make it look nice so far - introduce Bootstrap</li>
          <li class="task-complete">Reorder files and folders to make development nicer</li>
          <li>Book a slot for a Meeting Room</li>
          <li>Cancel a booking</li>
          <li>Try to make it look nice again!</li>
          <li>Adding User accounts and permissions</li>
          <li>Security - removing rapid prototyping features</li>
          <li>Deploying to node.js server</li>
          <li>Deploying to Meteor infrastructure</li>

      <h2>Current state of our application</h2>
      <p>
        Now we have:
        <ul>
          <li>A booking mechanism and a template that shows the bookings in the table.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Things to talk about</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Come on Handlebars!!!  We can't name the scopes of nested blocks?!</li>
          <li>Handlebars.registerHelper()</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
        
    <div class="well">
      <h3>Things to experiment with</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Add some new bookings.  Watch on multiple browsers.</li>
          <li>Handlebars&lsquo; lack of variable setters.  Any ideas?  Ember.js seems to allow you to...</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
        
  {{else}}  

    <div class="alert alert-info">
      <p>
        Logic has now been put into the template to show our current bookings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Handlebars is making life hard within the nested loops to reference variables from different scopes.  To access parent scopes you can use "..", but this is very ugly.  Using custom helper methods to name scopes is not much better.
